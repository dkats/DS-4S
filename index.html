	<h1>Down Syndrome Societal Services and Supports Survey</h1>

	<p>The Down Syndrome Societal Services and Supports Survey (DS-4S) was developed to create an international holistic, country-level measure of societal services and supports for people with Down syndrome. While the biology/genetics behind Down syndrome are the same across the globe, people with Down syndrome can have significantly different opportunities depending on their social, economic, and political environments. We created this survey to identify the unmet needs of people with Down syndrome, as well as countries that can be used as "gold standards" for supporting people with Down syndrome.</p>

	<p>For more information about the group behind this project, please see the <a href="about.html">About Us</a> page.</p>
