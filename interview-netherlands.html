<h3>The Dutch Down Syndrome Foundation: Lessons on Empowering Families Through Knowledge</h3>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>—By Lexie Gozdiff Spognardi, MS, MPH</strong></p>

<p>At the heart of advancing the rights and quality of life for people with Down syndrome is understanding what truly works. The Down Syndrome Human Rights Survey aims to do just that—identify the systems, policies, and practices that elevate quality of life and ensure equity for people with Down syndrome. The Netherlands emerged as a global leader, ranking as a leader in <strong>healthcare</strong> among the 50 participating countries. This achievement is in no small part thanks to the <strong>Dutch Down Syndrome Foundation (SDS)</strong>.</p>

<h5>A Holistic Approach to Healthcare</h5>

<p>The Dutch healthcare system stands out for its innovative and inclusive approach to supporting people with Down syndrome. One of its standout features is “Downteams,” multidisciplinary teams of doctors who work together to provide comprehensive medical checkups tailored to individuals with Down syndrome.</p>

<p>For children, this kind of care is common across the country, making it easier for families to access specialized support. For adults, the availability of these services is more limited. While there are seven Downteams for adults, these are all concentrated in the southern region. Nevertheless, the structure of these Downteams mirrors similar models, such as the one at the <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/down-syndrome">Massachusetts General Hospital Down Syndrome Program</a>, demonstrating how collaboration among medical professionals can yield effective results.</p>

<p>The SDS has played a vital role in supporting healthcare advancements in the Netherlands. The organization’s expertise is often garnered to help develop national guidelines, consent forms, and educational materials. The SDS not only works with Dutch healthcare professionals but also collaborates internationally. For instance, the first Dutch guidelines for Down syndrome were based on American guidelines, translated and adapted by the SDS to fit the Dutch healthcare landscape. In recent years, Dutch pediatricians decided to develop their own Dutch guidelines on the basis of extensive literature review and collaboration with specialists in different medical areas and input from the SDS. The SDS invests in strong partnerships with medical specialists, nationally and internationally, connecting them to each other, to Down syndrome research, and to questions from parents.</p>

<h5>Accessible Resources for Families</h5>

<p>One of SDS’s most significant contributions is their commitment to empowering families through information. The foundation has developed <a href="https://downsyndroom.nl/">a website</a> that provides resources for the whole lifespan with information on how to deal with the possible challenges that people with Down syndrome and their families can face at different stages. The SDS believes it is essential that families have access to the same information about Down syndrome as professionals and strives to make this information accessible and easy to understand.</p>

<p>Medical information is made available by the SDS in <a href="https://downsyndroom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VADEMECUM-ORIGINEEL.pdf">a comprehensive guide</a> on Down syndrome, which is available online for free in Dutch. This guide equips parents and caregivers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. The website, the different guides, along with the SDS's information packets for expecting families, ensure that every family is met with understanding and support from the beginning.</p>

<p>Pediatricians, midwives, and gynecologists across the Netherlands frequently refer families to the SDS website, and government-distributed brochures ensure widespread awareness of these resources. Importantly, the creation of these materials involves close collaboration among patient organizations, healthcare providers, and policymakers, ensuring they reflect the diverse perspectives and needs of the
community.</p>

<p>In addition to healthcare concerns, the SDS addresses the challenges parents face when arranging and funding (inclusive) education. An SDS initiative called “<a href="https://downsyndroom.nl/home-downacademy/">DownAcademy</a>” offers a listening ear and provides clear information on the available options. DownAcademy helps parents of children with Down syndrome navigate the complexities of education by offering guidance on school choices, laws, and funding. Through informational sessions and personalized support, DownAcademy empowers parents to make informed decisions about whether to enroll their children in special education or public school. In addition, DownAcademy provides training for parents, teachers, and professionals on topics like early intervention, behavior management, and sexuality. It also connects families with ambassador schools experienced in teaching students with Down syndrome. By blending theory with practice, DownAcademy equips families and professionals to foster inclusive educational environments; however, achieving widespread inclusion remains a challenge in the Netherlands.</p>

<h5>Advocacy and Community</h5>

<p>The SDS doesn’t stop at providing resources—it actively advocates for people with Down syndrome on a national and international level. Working with organizations like <a href="https://iederin.nl/">Iederin</a>, they influence policy and drive systemic change. A large challenge for coming years is ensuring a more inclusive educational system. Families are at the core of the mission, with the SDS organizing national and regional meetings where parents can connect, exchange experiences, and learn from one another.</p>

<p>The SDS also emphasizes early intervention, a critical component of lifelong health and success for individuals with Down syndrome. By disseminating information through their website, quarterly magazine <i>Down+Up</i>, digital newsletters, social media, training courses, and lectures, the SDS ensures that families, educators, and healthcare professionals remain up to date with the latest research and best practices.</p>

<h5>Looking Ahead: Building on Success</h5>

<p>As the Down Syndrome Human Rights Survey prepares for its second phase in 2025, there is much to learn from organizations like the SDS. Their holistic approach to healthcare, emphasis on collaboration, and unwavering commitment to empowering families exemplify what’s possible on a national scale.</p>

<p>The SDS’s success invites reflection: What could this look like on a larger scale in countries with greater geographic and demographic challenges? How can other nations replicate their achievements to ensure every family feels supported and empowered?</p>
