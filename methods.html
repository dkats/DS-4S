<h2>Methods</h2>

	<h4>Survey Development</h4>
		<p>The Working Group participated in a modified Delphi method over a period of 18 months using Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as a framework. First, relevant previously published indicators were identified. For each domain, approximately 10&ndash;20 previously published survey items were initially proposed to the Working Group. Each Working Group member then assessed each survey item with the following questions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Setting aside the specific question wording for this indicator, would this subject matter/content be useful to know?</li>
			<li>How easy would it be for your Down syndrome organization to answer this question on behalf of your population?</li>
			<li>What wording change would have made this question easier to answer?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Working Group's evaluation of each survey item was then discussed during a live video conference call. Participants were also given the opportunity to suggest/discuss additional survey items. During 14 meetings from 2018&ndash;2020, we considered 140 possible items, which we reduced to the 61 in the final DS-4S.</p>

	<h4>Inclusion Criteria</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>The organization had a holistic focus on the lives of people with DS&mdash;i.e., not limited to specific issues, such as a dance or therapy group.</li>
			<li>At least 50% of the organizationâ€™s members either have DS or are family members of people with DS.</li>
		</ol>

	<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
		<p>To generate the domain scores and an overall score for each organization, we performed factor analysis:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Factor analysis was performed on the indicators within each domain to obtain a "factor loading"</li>
			<li>Each indicator was normalized by creating a z-score (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1)</li>
			<li>The domain score was generated for each organization by multiplying the z-score of the indicator with the corresponding factor loading of the indicator and then summing across all the indicators in the domain</li>
			<li>Each country's domain score was generated by taking the average of the domain scores across all organizations within the country</li>
			<li>Each country's overall score was generated by summing across all the domain scores</li>
		</ol>
