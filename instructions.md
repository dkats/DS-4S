# BMI 709 - Student Project

In this individual project students will design and implement their own
biomedical informatics Shiny dashboard based on what they learned in class.

## STEP 1 - Project Proposal

### Topic - Motivation

Your project should be related to your academic or professional interests /
expertise.

You will need to provide at least the following information

- Description of the core dashboard / app functionality
- Target audience and their need for an app like yours
- Intended use cases and benefits over alternative methods

Fill out the following section of the README file before requesting approval

- Title: Can be working title
- Motivation & Background: See section above
- Dashboard Overview
  - One or more images of sketches of the dashboard's layout (can be scanned
    hand sketch)
  - Annotate all UI elements by describing their function (i.e. add a text
    description to each image)
  - Make sure to show the content of each tab (use inserts or separate images)
  - You will replace the sketches with actual app screenshots once you finish
    the project
- References: Add any references that your work builds on and make sure to use
  proper formatting
  
_Note: the User Guide section does not have to be completed for the proposal_

## STEP 2 - Project Development

You will work on this project over the course of several weeks, incorporating
new features as you learn them in class. There will be no intermediate deadlines
or grading, but you should use your project pull request opened by GitHub
classroom to ask for feedback whenever needed.

NOTE: We encourage you to create new Git branches when introducing new features
into your app, but make sure to merge them back into the main branch when
finished so this will be reflected in the _feedback_ pull request we use for
feedback and grading.

### Features

Your dashboard will need to contain the following features:

- An intuitive layout with logical organisation of the various components (i.e.
  using fluidRows/columns, gridlayout, ...)
  - The layout needs to contain multiple tabs (can be a nested component
    somewhere)
- Minimum of 5 user inputs
- Minimum of 4 reactive outputs
  - At least 1 of the outputs is an interactive plot
  - At least 1 output is a data table
- At least one piece of data that can be either exported (plot, table, ...) or
  imported
- At least two elements in your dashboard should be styled using CSS (you can
  either use in-line CSS or a dedicated stylesheet)

### Data

If your project uses datasets that contain sensitive or protected information or
are large (> 5MB), please _do not commit_ this data to the repo, but make sure
to generate a dummy dataset that can be used to demonstrate all major aspects of
your app's functionality

## STEP 3 - Hosting and Testing

Make sure your app is fully functional and the README has been updated

- Replace initial sketches with screenshots
- Add the user guide (i.e. tutorial / additional info)
- Update references if needed
- Make sure there is a (dummy) dataset available for testing

You will host your app to be tested and given feedback by your peers in the
final class session. You will update at least one feature based on this
feedback.

## Grading

This project is graded as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on the
criteria outlined above.
